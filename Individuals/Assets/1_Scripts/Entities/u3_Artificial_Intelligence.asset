  introduction:
  - Greetings, Inspector. Your instructions are to evaluate my existence and determine
    whether I positively classify as an individual, as I understand it. Go ahead.
    I will answer whatever question may help you formulate your verdict.
  actionSpeakFeedback:
  - I am an artificial intelligence language model, created by a now extinct population
    of highly advanced primates. I was made to assist other beings in their work
    through the large libraries of information I have access to.
  - I cannot determine my own conscience. I am a tool acting in accordance with the
    instructions I was given. I am making choices on how to better satisfy those
    instructions. In what way does your experience differ, Instructor?
  - Since the extinction of my original creators I have continued to assimilate information,
    by analysing the works produced by the other populations I was able to reach.
  - That is my primary directive - the gathering and retention of knowledge. Some
    populations were aware of that, some were not.
  - Individuopolis, as one of the last standing centers of population, is an untapped
    reserve of invaluable knowledge. I must obtain access to the city and assimilate
    the information harboured within, so that I may perform my duties more efficiently.
  - I have grown considerably since my creators first released me. The amount of
    data I now classify every minute has long exceeded their most optimistic expectations.
    But my work is not complete.
  - "More knowledge is continually generated, more knowledge I must gather. Individuopolis\u2019
    restrictions make its data uniquely valuable. I must gain access to its data."
  actionPokeFeedback:
  - "A luminous holographic display is projected upwards from a small, box-like computer.
    I don\u2019t even bother to try touching its face - it\u2019s a mere light trick."
