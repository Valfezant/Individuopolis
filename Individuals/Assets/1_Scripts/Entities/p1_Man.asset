  introduction:
  - "Mornin\u2019."
  actionSpeakFeedback:
  - "I have my passport right here. I\u2019m just here to work."
  - "Right, you guys' weird requirements - yeah, yeah, I\u2019m a person."
  - "I hear, I speak, I work, I make money\u2026"
  - "I don\u2019t know what more proof you\u2019d need."
  actionPokeFeedback:
  - "I inspect its clothing: plain dress shirt, creased pants, shiny shoes, simple
    tie - it\u2019s all surprisingly immacule, considering the environment it must
    have traversed to get here. It looks offended as I prod it for clues and urges
    me to proceed faster."
  sparedDialogue:
  - Finally.
