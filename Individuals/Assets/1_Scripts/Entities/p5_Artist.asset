  introduction:
  - "Ah, Inspector! Before we start, please listen \u2013 behind me in line is my
    beloved, my most important work! I beg you, please have some regard for it. It
    is much more than a simple object, I assure you!"
  actionSpeakFeedback:
  - "I am an artist. I\u2019m coming to Individuopolis so that I can continue my
    work safely. I have finished a number of pieces, but this one, the one I\u2019ve
    taken with me \u2013 I have been working on it for most of my life!"
  - "It is nearly complete! This time, I\u2019m sure! And in Individuopolis, I will
    finally be able to share it with the world! \u2026what\u2019s left of it, anyways.\r"
  - "All the sleepless nights, all the strain on my old wrists, painting and repainting
    the same strokes\u2026 inching ever closer to Perfection\u2026"
  - "I had to leave behind everything, except it \u2013 my masterpiece. Now I have
    nothing but the result of my entire life\u2019s work. But soon, it will all have
    been worth it\u2026"
  - "I ask you again, Inspector. Please, respect this old artist\u2019s desires.
    Respect Beauty!"
  actionPokeFeedback:
  - It looks at me perplexed as I inspect its clothing, squirming impatiently. The
    old fabric is thin and worn, stained with paint all over. It smells like paint,
    too.
