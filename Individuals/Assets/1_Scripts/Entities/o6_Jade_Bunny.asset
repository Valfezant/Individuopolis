  - "It\u2019s made of a smooth, cold material I\u2019ve never seen before, cloudy
    and glossy at the same time. Its delicate shapes were rendered expertly, and
    the two tiny red gemstones functioning as eyes are fixated on me. I nearly expect
    it to jump at me. Judging by its artisanal quality, it\u2019s incredibly antique."
