  introduction:
  - "Excuse me, kind sir, did you happen to see my son pass through here? I lost
    track of him as we got into the queue, but I\u2019m certain he was just a few
    places ahead of me."
  actionSpeakFeedback:
  - Yes, my son, he looks just like me. Quite a handsome lad, indeed.
  - "Oh I sure hope he has not gotten into any trouble while I was behind. He can
    be a bit of a rascal, that one. But, ah, so are most youngins after all\u2026
    so full of life\u2026"
  actionPokeFeedback:
  - "Rough surface, contrasting with the elegant, shimmering silk of the finely-detailed
    tophat. At my touch, it nervously inquires about its \u201Cson\u201D once more."
